# Archive: Removed Axioms

This file is for HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION ONLY. It preserves axioms that
were removed from the main proof. DO NOT import, reference, or use any
code from this file.

The file extension is .lean.txt specifically to prevent it from being
compiled or counted as part of the codebase.

================================================================================

**Purpose**: Preserves axioms that were removed from the main proof path.
These represent an alternative "Weil positivity" approach to RH that was
never fully implemented.

**Why Removed**: The main proof chain only uses `zero_implies_kernel`.
These axioms were intended for an alternative proof path via the Weil
explicit formula that was never completed.

**Potential Value** (for future reference only):
- The Weil explicit formula is a deep result in analytic number theory
- Plancherel in Cl(N,N) form connects to Fourier analysis
- zeros_isolated captures RH in a symmetric form

**Note**: This file does NOT compile - it's for documentation only.
The definitions it references are still in Definitions.lean.

## Axiom: The Geometric Explicit Formula

The distributional form of the prime-zero duality:
  PrimeSignal(φ) = ZeroResonance(φ) + VolumeCorrections(φ)

This is the Weil explicit formula in Cl(N,N) language.

**Mathematical Content**:
The Weil explicit formula relates sums over primes to sums over zeros:
  Σ_p log(p) · φ(log p) = Σ_ρ φ̂(γ_ρ) + (correction terms)

In our geometric formulation:
- PrimeSignal(φ) encodes the left side (sum over primes)
- ZeroResonance(φ) encodes the right side (sum over zeros)
- The equality is the deep arithmetic-analytic duality

**Status**: Never used in main proof. Would require Weil_Positivity_Criterion
to complete the proof path.

--   (phi.toFun 0 * Real.log (2 * Real.pi))

## Axiom: Plancherel Identity (Cl(N,N) form)

The energy in log-space equals the integrated squared magnitude in phase-space:
  ∫ |φ(x)|² dx = (1/2π) ∫ |φ̂(t)|²_Cl dt

This connects the prime-side (log-space) to the zero-side (phase-space).

**Mathematical Content**:
Standard Plancherel: ∫|f|² = ∫|𝓕f|²

In Cl(N,N) form:
- LogSpaceEnergy = ∫ |φ(x)|² dx (prime side)
- ClSquaredMagnitude = |FourierScalar|² + |FourierBivector|² (zero side)
- The 1/2π factor comes from physicist vs mathematician Fourier conventions

**Status**: Never used in main proof. PlancherelBridge.lean documents the
connection to Mathlib's Plancherel theorem.

--     LogSpaceEnergy phi = (1 / (2 * Real.pi)) * ∫ t : ℝ, ClSquaredMagnitude phi t

## Axiom: Uniqueness of Real Part per Imaginary Part

If two zeros in the critical strip have the same imaginary part t,
they must have the same real part σ.

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT the standard "isolated zeros" theorem!

The standard identity theorem says zeros of analytic functions are
topologically isolated (can't accumulate). This is automatic.

This axiom is MUCH STRONGER: it says zeros are unique per horizontal line.

**Why this is equivalent to RH**:
Combined with the functional equation (which pairs zeros (σ,t) and (1-σ,t)):
1. If ζ(σ+it)=0, then ζ((1-σ)+it)=0 (functional equation)
2. Both zeros have the same t
3. By this axiom: σ = 1-σ, hence σ = 1/2

This axiom encodes RH in the form: "zeros can't exist at symmetric
positions off the critical line."

**Status**: Used in ReversionForcesRH.lean (alternative proof path).
Now marked with sorry since the axiom was removed.

--     (hz₁ : IsGeometricZeroParam s₁) (hz₂ : IsGeometricZeroParam s₂)
--     (h_same_t : s₁.t = s₂.t) :
--     s₁.sigma = s₂.sigma

## Axiom: The Weil Positivity Criterion (Also Removed Earlier)

The Cl(n,n) positivity combined with the explicit formula forces all
zeros to lie on σ = 1/2.

**Mathematical Content**:
This axiom encapsulates the deep analytic content that:
- Positivity of squared magnitudes (sum of squares ≥ 0)
- Combined with the explicit formula (primes ↔ zeros)
- Forces zeros onto the critical line

**Note**: This is EQUIVALENT to RH - it's the Weil criterion statement.

**Status**: Removed because it was never used. zeros_isolated serves
the same purpose (both encode RH).

## Summary: The Alternative Proof Path

The removed axioms represent a different approach to proving RH:

**Path 1 (Current - Spectral)**:
```
zero_implies_kernel → spectral_mapping → Critical_Line_from_Zero_Bivector → σ = 1/2
```

**Path 2 (Removed - Weil Positivity)**:
```
Geometric_Explicit_Formula + Plancherel_ClNN + Weil_Positivity_Criterion → RH
```

**Path 3 (Removed - Functional Equation)**:
```
functional_equation_zero + zeros_isolated → σ = 1/2
```

Path 1 is complete (modulo the single axiom).
Paths 2 and 3 were never fully implemented.

**Potential Mathlib Value**:
- The Weil explicit formula statements could inform future Mathlib additions
- The Plancherel bridge (physicist ↔ mathematician conventions) is documented in PlancherelBridge.lean
- zeros_isolated shows an interesting reformulation of RH
