# Unused Axioms - Archived 2026-01-23

These axioms were found to have 0 references in the codebase and were
removed from the proof chain.

## 1. equidistribution_bound (from BridgeObligations.lean:262)

```lean
/-- Quantitative equidistribution hypothesis -/
axiom equidistribution_bound (x : ℝ) (t : ℝ) (hx : 1 < x) :
    |∑ p ∈ Finset.filter Nat.Prime (Finset.range ⌊x⌋₊),
      Real.cos (t * Real.log p)| ≤ Real.sqrt x * (Real.log x) ^ 2
```

**Purpose**: CLT-type bound on prime cosine sums.
**Why Deleted**: Never used in any proof. The equidistribution property was
intended for an alternative proof strategy that was never implemented.

## 2. scalarPart (from CliffordFoundation.lean:60)

```lean
-- Extracts the scalar (real) part of a Clifford element
-- (Implementation requires CliffordAlgebra.Proj)
axiom scalarPart (n : ℕ) : ClElement n → ℝ
```

**Purpose**: Abstract interface for scalar projection from Clifford algebra.
**Why Deleted**: The concrete Clifford implementation uses different approach
(diagonal operators in ℓ²). This abstract interface was never connected to
any proof chain.

## Verification

Run this to confirm these axioms are still unused:
```bash
grep -rn "equidistribution_bound\|scalarPart" Riemann --include="*.lean" | grep -v archive | grep -v "-- "
```

If this returns no results (excluding comments), the axioms remain unused.
