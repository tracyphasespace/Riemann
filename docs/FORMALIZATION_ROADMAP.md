# Roadmap to Formalize CliffordRH as a Proof

## Goal

Promote the scalar criterion:

```
Trace(sigma, t) < -5  AND  d(Trace)/d(sigma) > 25
```

from a **numerical detector** to a **formal equivalence** with:

```
zeta(1/2 + it) = 0
```

## Current State

### What We Have (Proven)

1. **Trace Definition** (CliffordRH.lean):
   ```lean
   def rotorTrace (sigma t : ℝ) (primes : List ℕ) : ℝ :=
     2 * primes.foldl (fun acc p =>
       acc + log p * (p : ℝ) ^ (-sigma) * cos (t * log p)
     ) 0
   ```

2. **Component Decomposition** (proven):
   ```lean
   theorem rotorSum_components :
     V 0 0 = sum of cos terms
     V 1 0 = sum of sin terms
   ```

3. **Trace of Rotation** (proven):
   ```lean
   theorem trace_rotor (theta : ℝ) : trace (rotor theta) = 2 * cos theta
   ```

### What We Know (Mathematically)

The trace equals twice the real part of the von Mangoldt sum:

```
Trace(sigma, t) = 2 * Re[ sum_p log(p) * p^{-s} ]
               = 2 * Re[ -zeta'(s)/zeta(s) ]  (for k=1 terms)
```

At a zero rho = 1/2 + i*gamma:
- zeta'(s)/zeta(s) has a **simple pole** with residue 1
- The real part of this pole contributes **negatively** to the trace
- This explains why trace < 0 at zeros

## Dependencies to Resolve

| Step | Required Proof | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1. Define `Trace(sigma, t)` | Symbolic prime sum | DONE |
| 2. Show `Trace = 2*Re[-zeta'/zeta]` | Dirichlet series derivation | NEEDS PROOF |
| 3. Prove: `trace(t) < 0 => pole nearby` | zeta'/zeta pole structure | NEEDS PROOF |
| 4. Formalize d/dsigma positivity | Derivative behavior around zero | NEEDS PROOF |
| 5. Conclude: criterion => RH | All zeros at sigma = 1/2 | NEEDS PROOF |

## Strategy 1: Via Explicit Formula

Use the Weil explicit formula to connect primes to zeros:

```
sum_p log(p) * f(log p) = f(0) * log(2*pi)
                        - sum_rho f_hat(rho)
                        + integral terms
```

The trace is essentially `sum_p log(p) * p^{-s}`, which relates directly to `sum_rho` over zeros.

## Strategy 2: Via Logarithmic Derivative

1. **Start with**: `-zeta'(s)/zeta(s) = sum_n Lambda(n) / n^s`

2. **For primes only** (k=1): `sum_p log(p) / p^s`

3. **Real part**: `Re[...] = sum_p log(p) * p^{-sigma} * cos(t * log p) = Trace/2`

4. **At zero rho**: `-zeta'(s)/zeta(s)` has pole with residue 1

5. **Behavior**: Near rho, the real part goes to -infinity (from the right)

6. **Conclusion**: `Trace < 0` indicates proximity to a zero

## Strategy 3: Direct Numerical to Formal Bridge

Prove that the numerical criterion is **necessary and sufficient**:

**Necessity** (easier): If zeta(s) = 0, prove trace < 0
- Uses pole structure of zeta'/zeta

**Sufficiency** (harder): If trace < 0 (with conditions), prove zeta(s) = 0
- Requires showing no other source of trace negativity

## Key Identities Needed

1. **Von Mangoldt**:
   ```
   -zeta'(s)/zeta(s) = sum_{n=1}^infty Lambda(n) / n^s
   ```

2. **Prime contribution**:
   ```
   Lambda(p) = log(p)  for prime p
   Lambda(p^k) = log(p) for prime power
   Lambda(n) = 0 otherwise
   ```

3. **Partial fraction** (at simple zero rho):
   ```
   zeta'(s)/zeta(s) = 1/(s - rho) + holomorphic
   ```

4. **Real part behavior**:
   ```
   Re[1/(sigma + it - rho)] = (sigma - Re(rho)) / |s - rho|^2
   ```
   This is negative when sigma < Re(rho).

## The Ratio Invariant

Numerical evidence shows:
```
ratio = |d(trace)/d(sigma)| / |trace| ~ 4.86 +/- 1.87 at zeros
```

This stability suggests a **geometric invariant** that could be formalized.

## Payoff

If successful:
- A **real-valued, geometric formulation** of RH
- **No complex analysis** required in the formalization
- **No operator theory** or spectral axiom
- The proof becomes: "primes create rotors; trace negativity detects zeros; zeros force sigma = 1/2"

## Estimated Difficulty

| Component | Difficulty | Mathlib Support |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Dirichlet series | Medium | Good |
| zeta'/zeta pole structure | Hard | Partial |
| Explicit formula | Very Hard | Minimal |
| Identity theorem for extension | Hard | Partial |

## Recommended Path

1. **Short term**: Keep CliffordRH as numerical validator alongside Fredholm path
2. **Medium term**: Prove `Trace = 2*Re[-zeta'/zeta]` symbolically
3. **Long term**: Formalize the pole-to-negativity correspondence
