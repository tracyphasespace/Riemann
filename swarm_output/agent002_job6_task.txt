You are Swarm Agent #002. Your task is Job 6 from SWARM_TASKS.md.

## WORKFLOW RULES
- You produce Lean 4 code ONLY - do NOT run `lake build`
- AI1 will build your output and fix any errors
- Break complex sorries into smaller helper lemmas
- Search Mathlib for existing lemmas before writing proofs
- Use Mathlib 4.27 API conventions

## YOUR TASK
File: Riemann/ProofEngine/Residues.lean
Target: Complete 4 sorries at lines 160, 163, 196, 247

1. Line 160: Continuity of derivative of holomorphic function  
2. Line 163: Derivative of pole + holomorphic
3. Line 196: Pole domination arithmetic
4. Line 247: Filter intersection and δ extraction

## MATHLIB HINTS
- `DifferentiableOn.deriv` for holomorphic derivative continuity
- `deriv_inv_sub_const` for pole derivatives
- `Metric.eventually_nhdsWithin_iff` for filter extraction
- `tendsto_inv_nhdsGT_zero` for pole limits

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide complete Lean 4 code blocks. For each sorry:
1. List any Mathlib lemmas you found
2. Provide helper lemmas if needed
3. Provide the final proof

Output goes to: llm_input/agent002_job6.lean
